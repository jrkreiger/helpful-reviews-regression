# "Helpful" reviews: a regression approach
_A machine learning mini-project (in progress)_

This project aims to predict the "helpfulness" (as rated by readers) of over 300,000 product reviews from Amazon. In another project, I approached this as a classification problem using NLP to focus on the texts of the reviews themselves. Here I use other features, some from the original dataset, others engineered by me. You can [view the original dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

The key packages used in this project are scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.

This is a work in progress, so check back occasionally for updates.
